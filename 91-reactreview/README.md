# React Debugging Lab

Flatiron School has decided to dabble in the food industry and just opened up a brand new fast casual Mexican restaurant (not at all a clone of a certain popular restaurant). Engineers were hired to design a web app to allow users to submit orders online, but they mysteriously disappeared and left everything broken. It's now your job to try to find all the bugs and fix the app!

## Setup

* Clone this repository and `cd` into it
* Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install dependencies
* Run `npm start` or `yarn start` to start the app locally

## Deliverables

1. A user should be able to see an order form with options for protein, fillings, toppings, and sides.
2. A user should be able to select as many proteins, fillings, toppings, and sides as they desire.
3. A user should be able to submit the form with their selections and see their order(s) listed under "All Orders."
4. If a user selects any sides, they should be able to click on a button to view their side choices.


## Helpful Things to Keep In Mind

* **Read** the errors you receive in your browser and console
* `console.log`, `debugger`, and **React Dev Tools** are your friends
* Did we *return* the values we want?
* Why would **this** be undefined?
* Did we import and export our components correctly?
* Did we pass down the *props* that we need?
* How do we change state?
* This app uses Semantic for styling - you will not need to worry about any errors here.
